# Advent of Code 2025

Practising my acquired knowledge of `rust`.

*⚠️ NOTE ⚠️* Most of these solutions are uploaded without any sort of cleanup, so
lower expectations on code readibility and abstraction.

Using the [advent-of-code-rust](https://github.com/fspoettel/advent-of-code-rust)
template.

## Running

```fish
# Simplest way to scaffold a day.

# Time.
cargo time <day> [--all] [--store]
```

## Testing
